# FINAL PROJECT â€“ Segment 1
#
# Overview of Project
## Our team will analyze recent population migration within the United States and compare our findings to the corresponding cost of living in those areas. Even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, news stories routinely cited the general trend of people relocating from high-cost areas (e.g. New York and California) to lower-cost areas (e.g. Texas and Florida). Our project will investigate the validity of this generally accepted pattern and investigate the importance of day-to-day living costs in determining the magnitude of the migration.
#
# Data Sources
## Our work will rely heavily on publicly available data. Census data, including yearly state-to-state migration databases and five-year cumulative county-to-county migration databases, have already been downloaded in Excel format. Preprocessing will include use of VBA scripts to remove extraneous descriptive material from the Excel files, followed by execution of Python code to improve the integrity of the data and prepare for SQL upload. We anticipate that our work will include the evaluation of Kaggle, Advisorsmith and Bureau of Labor Statistics data to obtain values representing the cost of living throughout the country.
#
# Questions That We Hope to Answer
## We intend to confirm or refute the general perception that net migration is taking place and the relative importance of cost of living in the population trends. Time permitting, we hope to build on this primary analysis and identify other trends such as the preference of relocated individuals for urban/suburban/rural destinations, states and counties that have experienced that biggest population change to migration, etc.
#
# Model
## As we anticipate all input and output will have essentially continuous rather than discrete structure, we expect to use a multiple linear regression as our first model. Based on the outcome, we will alternate model forma.
